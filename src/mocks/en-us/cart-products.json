    "short_description": "Keeping a distinctive complex pattern without being complicated involves choosing a simple palette. The poinsettia red and ivory white in this cushion cover are two lovely colors that we enjoy all season long. The sweater-like snowflake design celebrates more than one type of holiday (reverse is sherpa-like sheepskin). Make it a snow day. The front is made of 100% yarn-dyed acrylic; It is reversed to 100% recycled polyester sherpa in white. Yarn dyed fabric has amazing vivid colors that keep their radiance over time. Holds 16 \"x 26\" fill (sold separately).",
